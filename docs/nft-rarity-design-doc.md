# NFT Collection Rarity Design Document
## "The 420 Syndicate" - A Power-Based Rarity System

### Core Concept: The Laws of Power
Your collection uses the 48 Laws of Power as a central thematic element through the Glyph system. This creates a natural hierarchy and meaning system that goes beyond simple statistical rarity.

## Rarity Tiers Overview

### 1. **The Untouchables** (7 NFTs - 1.67%)
- The legendary tier
- Each possesses a unique "Sovereign Glyph" (Laws 1-7)
- Can break normal incompatibility rules
- Maximum trait count (13)
- Special combinations impossible for others

### 2. **The Capos** (35 NFTs - 8.33%)
- Elite enforcers
- Possess "Capo Glyphs" (Laws 8-14, 5 each)
- Access to rare trait combinations
- 11-12 traits minimum

### 3. **The Made** (84 NFTs - 20%)
- Established members
- Possess "Soldier Glyphs" (Laws 15-28, 6 each)
- Balanced rare/common traits
- 10-11 traits typical

### 4. **The Associates** (210 NFTs - 50%)
- Loyal foot soldiers
- Possess "Street Glyphs" (Laws 29-48, ~10-11 each)

### 5. **The Unmarked** (84 NFTs - 20%)

- Can still be powerful through other traits
- Wild cards in the system
- 7-11 traits

## The Glyph Power System

### Sovereign Glyphs (Laws 1-7) - The Ultimate Power
1. **Law 1: Never Outshine the Master** - Grants immunity to rank restrictions
2. **Law 2: Never Put Too Much Trust in Friends** - Can combine incompatible weapons
3. **Law 3: Conceal Your Intentions** - Can wear any mask/hat combination
4. **Law 4: Always Say Less Than Necessary** - Minimal traits but maximum power
5. **Law 5: So Much Depends on Reputation** - Automatic Boss/Don rank
6. **Law 6: Court Attention at All Cost** - Maximum trait count guaranteed
7. **Law 7: Get Others to Do the Work** - Can have "impossible" servant traits

### Power Mechanics
- Glyphs interact with other traits to create "Power Scores"
- Certain glyphs unlock forbidden combinations
- Some glyphs enforce specific trait requirements
- The blank glyph represents "hidden power" - unpredictable

## Trait Distribution Refinements

### 1. **Rank Distribution (Tied to Glyphs)**
- Boss/Don (6) - Only possible with Glyphs 1-7 or special exception
- Joker/Wildcard (1) - The only Boss without a Sovereign Glyph
- Underboss (28) - Requires Capo or higher Glyph
- Capo (70) - Open to Made Glyphs and above
- Made Man (105) - Open to Soldier Glyphs and above
- Associate (210) - Default rank, any glyph including blank

  - Can access both male and female outfit styles
  - Exclusive access to certain tech traits
  - Higher base power score

## Rarity Calculation Formula

### Base Rarity Score
`(Statistical Rarity × 0.4) + (Glyph Power × 0.3) + (Set Bonus × 0.2) + (Trait Count × 0.1)`

### Glyph Power Values
- Sovereign (Laws 1-7): 100 points each
- Capo (Laws 8-14): 50 points each
- Soldier (Laws 15-28): 25 points each
- Street (Laws 29-48): 10 points each
- Blank: Variable (5-50 based on other traits)

### Set Bonuses
- Complete themed set: +40 points
- Partial set (3/4 items): +20 points
- Rule breaker combination: +60 points

## Post-Mint Discoveries
To maintain engagement, certain aspects are revealed after minting:
1. Which specific Law of Power each glyph represents
2. Hidden weapon traits for complete sets
3. Power score calculations
4. Secret incompatibility breaks
5. Lore connections between traits

## Collection Statistics
- **Total Supply**: 420
- **Unique Glyphs**: 48 (Laws of Power)
- **Blank Glyphs**: 84 (Hidden Power)
- **Legendary Items**: 28 (1-7 count items)
- **Rule Breakers**: 7 maximum
- **Complete Sets**: Estimated 20-30
- **Maximum Possible Power Score**: 300
- **Average Power Score**: 75-100

This system creates multiple paths to rarity and value:
1. Pure statistical rarity (traditional)
2. Glyph-based power (thematic)
3. Set completion (aesthetic)
4. Rule breaking (exclusive)
5. Trait count extremes (CryptoPunks-style)

The 48 Laws of Power theme provides narrative coherence while maintaining mathematical integrity for generation.
