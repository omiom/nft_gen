2. **Law combinations** create narrative possibilities (e.g., Law 3 + Law 46 = Perfect Spy)
3. **The blank glyphs** become valuable as "undefined potential"
4. **Sovereign holders** form natural leadership council
5. **Thematic coherence** drives long-term value beyond pure rarity

This system transforms your NFT collection from simple PFPs into a **strategic power game** where each holder embodies a principle from Machiavellian philosophy, creating deep engagement and cultural relevance.
